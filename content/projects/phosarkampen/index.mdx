*WIP! There's lots more to talk about this.*

This was a CCG project with visually unique cards for the yearly welcome of new students at Campus Skellefteå.

All the card graphics except for the portraits were procedurally generated in Substance Designer.

import img2018Example01 from "./2018-example-01.png";

<img src={img2018Example01} style="width: 70ch" />

To batch out a complete deck and provide automatic inputs like name, portrait, cardtype, etc. Substance Automation Toolkit was used to pipe card data into Substance Designer and generate all the cards.
