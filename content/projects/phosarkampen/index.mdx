_WIP! There's lots more to talk about this._

This is a card collecting game for the yearly welcome of new students at Campus Skellefteå.
Every year a new design developed to fit the theme for that year.

## 2018

All the card graphics except for the portraits were procedurally generated in Substance Designer.

import img2018Example01 from "./2018-example-01.png";

<img src={img2018Example01} style="width: 70ch" />

Substance Automation Toolkit was used to batch generate out a complete deck from Substance Designer graphs and provide automatic inputs like name, portrait, cardtype, etc.

## 2019

_WIP! Very similar to 2018 though._
