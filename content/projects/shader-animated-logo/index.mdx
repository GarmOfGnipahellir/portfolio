I had some spare time one evening and decided to do some animated logo design with shaders.

<div style="margin: auto">
  <iframe
    width="640"
    height="360"
    frameborder="0"
    src="https://www.shadertoy.com/embed/wdsGDH?gui=true&t=10&paused=true&muted=false"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center; margin: 0">

It's simply just drawing with a bunch of SDF functions nothing fancy, the tricky part was animating the water ripples.

Yes it's both water and beard, you can't see it? ;)

My first approach was also very aliased but it was hackily solved by raising the SDF function to a high exponent and clamping instead of stepping.
