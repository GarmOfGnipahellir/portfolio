This was a really quick project to test Unreal as a render engine, and therefore a bit rough around the edges.

The frame times for this landed on about 6 seconds on my RTX 2070 card.

The 4.26 update made rendering out movies even easier than before.
You now have greater control over settings with presets to optimize for different renders.

Maybe you want the previz to render quickly with TAA and realtime denoise and then have your final push the quality by disabling
all the realtime denoise features and temporal effects (which breaks convergence) to get as close as possible to the ground truth.  
Also rendering out passes is way easier and more powerful than ever!

Best of all though, having nearly the same result as the final render in realtime when you're working.

I would love to try this on a bigger project in the future!
